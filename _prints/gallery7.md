title: Creating a print
description_markdown: >-
  Lithography is a magical form of printing. The picture is drawn onto a flat
  piece of limestone. Chemicals are applied to the drawing causing a reaction to
  take place between the calcium in the limestone and the grease in the
  lithographic pencil. This means you can wipe away the original drawing, but
  bring it back by rolling the stone up in a printing ink. The inked stone goes
  through the printing press and the image is transferred, in reverse, to the
  paper.<br>The grain of the stone is inherent in my drawing. Its surface allows
  me to produce a fine textured, very tonal mark, unique to this process.<br>I
  print off editions of 20 and then hand-colour each print individually, as you
  might tint a photograph.

  A screenprint Is created by pushing printing ink through a fine mesh where
  areas have been blocked by a resin, preventing the ink from marking the paper,
  except where you want the image. My initial drawing goes onto a sheet of
  grainy acetate, which is then placed on a screen and placed in an exposure
  unit. When exposed the drawn image is transferred to the meshed screen. The
  texture on the acetate, which is picked up in the drawing is carried through
  to the printed piece. Each pisture is hand-coloured once the ink is dry.
