My figures are not assured in their place in the world. For them life is often a bit of a puzzle.&nbsp; Sometimes their world even spirals into the dreamlike and surreal. Things are not always as we think.</p><p>We all face constant change: uncertainty one moment and understanding the next. Frustration , then acceptance. Indecision, then resolution.&nbsp; But we quickly move on. I like to pause and capture some of these points in time. Just by looking, we are exposed.</p><p>I invite the viewer to become part of the moment&nbsp; and to question assumptions. Become part of the story and to observe or identify.</p><p>I explore the physicality, as well as the situation, of these people. By their very solidity, they are rooted to the spot. Possibly through choice, possibly through the inabilty to act. In the lithographs working on a piece of stone adds to the monumental nature of the figures. There is a sense of carving the images in two dimensions.</p><p>I hope that these pieces manage to stay fresh to the eye, as the discussion between the picture and the viewer continues over time, with new stories and new voices emerging.</p><p>Clare's work is on view at:</p><p><strong>Pyramid Gallery</strong><br />43 Stonegate, York YO1 8AW<br />Tel 0194 641 187<br />www.pyramidgallery.com<br /><br /><strong>Cupola Gallery</strong><br />178 Midddlewood Road<br />Sheffield S6 1TD<br />01142 852 665<br />www.cupolagallery.com<br /><br /><strong>Frivoli</strong><br />7a Devonshire Road<br />Chiswick, London W4 2EU<br />Tel 020 8742 3255<br /><strong><br />Bowie and Hulbert</strong><br />5 Market Street, Hay on Wye<br />Hereford HR3 5AF<br />Tel o1497 821 026<br />www.hayclay.co.uk</p></div>
