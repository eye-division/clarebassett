The DEC event took place at The Ovada Gallery in April 2010. It was a collaborative work involving four fine artists: Clare Bassett, Antonia Bruce, Kassandra Isaacson and Susan Moxley; a dancer, Susan Crow; a musician, Malcolm Atkins and a poet Robin Fitzpatrick.

Over a week there were successive evenings of live dance performance and live drawing from dance, as well as an exhibition of previous work. The event was open to invited, improvising dancers and musicians.

The DEC group also presented work at The Pegasus Theatre on 14th November, 2010, at a day of improvisation. Then in May the artists had an exhibition at The North Wall with some of the pictures made during these sessions.

I am continuing to work with dancers in workshops and rehearsal sessions, developing my dance pieces and exploring and trying to capture the movement and music.
