description_markdown: >-
  Drawing from live dance is a unique experience. There is no point where you
  can carefully study the figures, as they are constantly on the move. So you
  must focus differently. It is actually drawing the dance, not the dancer. You
  must respond to the music, the shapes and the forms. The marks you make are
  gestural and emotive and solely responsive. Hopefully the finished image will
  convey a sense of the dance to the viewer.
